            <h1>Walmart Bets General Rules</h1>
            <p>1. Walmart Bets will be played on Floor 12 only</p>
            <p>
              2. Every player starts with a budget that is determined per cycle.
              The budget has been set to 60 since 4.0
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Players will then use their budget to buy up to 8 characters to
              use for their run. Players are not allowed to go over the budget.
              Doing so will disqualify their run
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Certain characters and weapons will have penalties based on
              their constellation, these will be mentioned
              <a href="shop.html" class="shop-link">here</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              5. There used to be a leaderboard, but competition is discontinued
              for now. Players can still play to challenge themselves
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
              5. Walmart Bets will be split in 2 modes: Competitive and Casual.
              Competitive mode will hand out rewards at the end of each cycle.
              Casual mode will allow the player to shop with a bigger budget and
              play for fun
            </p>
            <p>
              6. Each cycle will consist of 2 weeks of trials followed by 2-4
              (depending on the patch) weeks of submissions. Players can only
              win welkins during the submission weeks. The duration of the
              submission weeks can always be found at the top of the shop
            </p>
            <p>
              7. Players can only participate for the prizes if they are atleast
              1 full cycle in the discord server
            </p>
            <p>
              8. The characters released during the submission weeks will not be
              available until the next patch. This is to prevent the character
              being underpriced for the competition
            </p> -->

            <p>
              1. The player needs to record their run and upload it to the
              respective channel. The run is only valid if the player clears
              floor 12 with 9 stars
            </p>
            <p>
              2. You are allowed to borrow other peoples account to submit a
              run, but by doing so won't make you eligible to claim the reward
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Each chamber can be retried until the player is satisfied with
              the run, but the player is not allowed to clear a chamber to then
              reset the whole floor. Leaving the abyss and retrying from chamber
              1 is counted as a separate run
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Every player can submit 3 runs max in the Competitive mode. The
              runs itself can't have the exact same teams, it has to have at
              least 1 new character compared to the previous 8. Casual mode can
              have repetitive teams with up to 5 submissions
            </p>
            <p>
              5. The video footage can be edited but if we spot inconsistencies,
              the run can be disqualified
            </p>
            <p>
              6. Each player can use any amount of 5* characters, but up to 2 5*
              Weapons. Some 5* characters have extra penalties on
              constellations, go to the
              <a href="shop.html" class="shop-link">shop</a> to find out what
              the penalties are
            </p>
            <p>
              7. We prefer you to include your weapons and constellations at the
              end of the video so we can make sure you didn't cheat while
              recording your run. We would also like to ask you to bind your
              account to the Genshin Wizard bot to verify that it is your
              account
            </p>
            <p>
              8. In case of a tie, the player with the least budget spent will
              come out on top. In the rare scenario that the budget is also tied
              it will be determined based who submitted the run earlier
            </p>
            <p>
              9. The top runner of every cycle will be rewards with a
              <b>welkin</b>. A player will not be eligible for the next reward
              after obtaining this reward to avoid a 1 player domination
              claiming all the rewards. You can only claim 1 welkin per year as
              there are around 6-7 cycles per year. The player can still compete
              on the leaderboard but the reward will be given to the first
              player that hasn't received a welkin
